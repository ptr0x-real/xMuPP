# xMuPP

xMuPP is an open source server emulator project of the game Mu Online Season 2.

We are using as base code the xTeam source (found here: http://forum.ragezone.com/f197/release-team-sources-s4-s6-1098374) which is a season 4/6/8 server emulator project. The idea is to fix the communication protocol of this project to comply with the game's season 2 protocol - for this we are using the Gx game server source code project to get the game's season 2 protocol (it can be found here: https://www.creandomu.com/index.php?topic=201.0).

The files of the client used in this project (v1.02c) can be found here: <MEGA.NZ>.
